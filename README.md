## Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Exploration & Market Analysis
**Goal:** Understand ERCOT market dynamics and renewable generation patterns

**Analysis:**
- 17,520 hours of ERCOT market data (2 years)
- Price distributions, volatility clustering, seasonality
- Wind/solar capacity factors by time-of-day and season
- Correlation analysis between prices, generation, and load

**Key Findings:**
- ERCOT prices exhibit strong volatility clustering (justifies GARCH modeling)
- Wind capacity factor: ~35% (higher in winter/evening)
- Solar capacity factor: ~25% (peaks at noon, zero at night)
- Wind-solar correlation: ρ ≈ 0.0 (excellent diversification potential)

**Technologies:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`

---

### Phase 2: Electricity Price Forecasting
**Goal:** Predict ERCOT prices and model volatility for risk assessment

**Models Implemented:**
1. **ARIMA(5,1,3)**: Time series baseline for trend/seasonality
2. **GARCH(1,1)**: Conditional heteroskedasticity modeling (from master thesis expertise)
3. **Random Forest**: Non-linear ML model with engineered features

**Feature Engineering:**
- Hour of day, day of week, month (cyclical encoding)
- Temperature, solar irradiance, wind speed
- Natural gas prices (marginal cost proxy)
- Rolling volatility windows

**Results:**
- GARCH model captures volatility clustering effectively (σ² persistence parameter β = 0.89)
- Random Forest achieves best out-of-sample accuracy (MAPE: 12.3%)
- Ensemble approach combines strengths: GARCH for risk, RF for point forecasts

**Technologies:** `statsmodels`, `arch`, `scikit-learn`

---

### Phase 3: Renewable Generation Modeling
**Goal:** Simulate realistic wind and solar generation profiles with uncertainty

**Approach:**
- **Deterministic modeling**: Physics-based capacity factors
  - Wind: Weibull distribution, power curve mapping
  - Solar: Clear-sky irradiance, temperature derating, cloud cover
- **Stochastic simulation**: Monte Carlo with 1,000 scenarios
  - Incorporates weather uncertainty
  - Models correlation between sites
  - Generates P10/P50/P90 production quantiles

**Validation:**
- Simulated distributions match historical benchmarks (NREL data)
- Seasonal patterns align with ERCOT operational data
- Capacity factors: Wind 33-37%, Solar 23-27% (realistic ranges)

**Technologies:** `numpy`, `scipy.optimize`, Monte Carlo simulation

---

### Phase 4: Portfolio Optimization
**Goal:** Find optimal wind-solar allocation to maximize risk-adjusted returns

**Framework: Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz)**
- **Objective:** Maximize Sharpe ratio = (Return - Risk-free rate) / Volatility
- **Constraints:**
  - Weights sum to 100%
  - Minimum 20% allocation per asset (diversification requirement)
  - Long-only positions (no shorting)

**Optimization Process:**
1. Generate 100 portfolios with different wind-solar mixes
2. Calculate expected return and volatility for each
3. Compute efficient frontier (Pareto-optimal portfolios)
4. Identify maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio

**Results:**
| Portfolio | Wind % | Solar % | Return ($/MW/yr) | Volatility ($/MW/yr) | Sharpe Ratio |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Optimal** | **52.1%** | **47.9%** | **$93,000** | **$12,800** | **2.12** |
| 100% Wind | 100% | 0% | $95,000 | $13,100 | 2.05 |
| 100% Solar | 0% | 100% | $88,000 | $15,400 | 1.52 |
| Naive 50/50 | 50% | 50% | $92,000 | $13,200 | 1.98 |

**Key Insights:**
- Optimal allocation achieves **27.2% risk reduction** vs. 100% solar
- Sharpe ratio improved by **7% vs. naive diversification**
- Wind dominance (52%) due to higher capacity factor and lower volatility

**Risk Metrics:**
- Value at Risk (95% confidence): $79,400/MW/year
- Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall): $75,200/MW/year
- Maximum drawdown (historical simulation): 17.3%

**Technologies:** `scipy.optimize`, `numpy`, constrained optimization

---

### Phase 5: Backtesting & Validation
**Goal:** Validate optimization on out-of-sample data and stress test

**Backtesting Framework:**
- **Training period:** Jan 2022 - Dec 2023 (portfolio optimization)
- **Test period:** Jan 2024 - Jun 2024 (validation)
- **Benchmarks:**
  - 100% Wind portfolio
  - 100% Solar portfolio
  - 50/50 Naive mix

**Performance Metrics:**
| Metric | Optimal Portfolio | 100% Wind | 100% Solar | 50/50 Mix |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Annualized Return | 9.2% | 8.8% | 7.1% | 8.4% |
| Annualized Volatility | 13.4% | 13.8% | 16.2% | 14.1% |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **1.92** | 1.71 | 1.02 | 1.58 |
| Maximum Drawdown | -17.3% | -18.1% | -22.4% | -18.9% |
| Sortino Ratio | 2.81 | 2.54 | 1.49 | 2.33 |
| Calmar Ratio | 0.53 | 0.49 | 0.32 | 0.44 |

**Stress Testing:**
- **High volatility regime** (VIX >30): Portfolio maintains positive returns
- **Low generation period** (drought): 50% wind helps mitigate solar underperformance
- **Price crash scenario** (-30% prices): Losses contained to -12% vs -18% for solar-only

**Statistical Validation:**
- Out-of-sample Sharpe ratio (1.92) within 10% of in-sample (2.12) ✓
- Rolling 6-month Sharpe ratio stable (1.7-2.2 range) ✓
- No significant regime shifts detected (stationary performance) ✓

**Conclusion:**
 Portfolio optimization validated on unseen data  
 Outperforms all single-asset and naive strategies  
 Risk-adjusted returns robust to market stress  

**Technologies:** `pandas`, performance analytics, Monte Carlo simulation

## Key Learnings & Insights

### 1. Diversification Works (But One Asset May Dominate)
- Optimal allocation (52/48) achieves measurable improvement over 50/50 naive mix
- However, wind's superior economics means 100% wind is close to optimal
- **Lesson:** Diversification helps, but don't force it if one asset is clearly superior

### 2. Correct Time Scaling is Critical
- **Initial mistake:** Annualized volatility without √12 scaling → Sharpe ratio of 176 (impossible!)
- **After fix:** Proper annualization → Sharpe ratio of 2.1 (realistic)
- **Lesson:** Always verify time-scaling conventions in financial metrics

### 3. Economic Viability Depends on Incentives
- Without RECs/PTCs: NPV = -$71M (NOT viable)
- With RECs/PTCs: NPV = +$22M (VIABLE)
- **Lesson:** Renewable energy projects critically depend on policy support

### 4. Energy Market Quirks Matter
- Solar peaks at noon (low prices due to oversupply)
- Wind stronger in evening (aligns with demand peak)
- **Lesson:** Generation profile matters as much as capacity factor

### 5. Backtesting Prevents Overfitting
- In-sample Sharpe: 2.12
- Out-of-sample Sharpe: 1.92 (within 10% → good!)
- **Lesson:** Always validate on holdout data to ensure robustness
